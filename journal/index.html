                <h2>Overlays Design Pattern Research</h2>
                <time datetime="2026-01-28">January 29, 2026</time>

                <p>The article, <a href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">Best Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows</a>, talks about the use of Modal windows and how they should be used. I’ve had prior experience with using modal windows as a UX designer. From the perspective of a UX designer, I did see the usefulness of modal windows. I thought that modal windows were ways to help clear up space on a page and reduce cognitive load, which it does. However, the article specified that now users would find modal windows inconvenient, and how you should use modal windows intentionally. 
                <br> It was interesting to see the basic anatomy of a modal window and the different attributes. This would help me as a designer to consider the design patterns that users are already familiar with. Reading the article makes me start to be more aware of the intentionality of using moral windows and how to effectively use them to help enhance users’ experience.

                <h2>Best Practices for Form Design</h2>
                <time datetime="2026-01-19">January 19, 2026</time>

                <p>When reading the article, <a href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best practices for form design</a> , I made connections between form design and UX design principles. The intent with these design principles is improve users’ experience when completing a form and making sure that users would interact with the form While I was familiar with most of the design principles mentioned, there were some practices that I knew I would consider when designing forms, like asking the complex questions last, putting the placeholder text where it wouldn’t disappear when users interact with the form, and explaining why we would need users’ sensitive information. Reading and learning more about form design helped me be able to keep in mind the user’s experience when designing and coding my projects for this class. </p>

                <p>A website that I’ve interacted with that exemplifies best practices would be the <a href="https://www.airbnb.com/?locale=en&country_override=US">Airbnb website</a>. As I was signing up for an Airbnb account, the process was simple and only required one page of forms, and the overall layout was simple and easy to navigate. </p>
