                    <h2>Visual Thinking Strategies Research</h2>
                    <time datatime="2026-02-10">February 10, 2026</time>

                    <p>While reading, that article <a
                            href="https://archive.nytimes.com/learning.blogs.nytimes.com/2015/02/27/10-intriguing-photographs-to-teach-close-reading-and-visual-thinking-skills/">"10
                            Intriguing Photographs to Teach Close Reading and Visual Thinking"</a> by Michael
                        Gonchar, I was able to think about the impact that photos have on one’s critical thinking skills
                        when engaging. You are starting to question the content we are interacting with more.
                        Questioning the purpose of why things are the way that they are and what they are to begin with.
                    </p>

                    <p>
                        When exploring on <a href="https://www.awwwards.com/">Awwwards.com</a>, I found this interactive website by Andrew Woan called <a href="https://www.mr-pandas-psychologically-safe-portfolio.com/">Mr
                        Panda’s Paper Portfolio</a>. The website felt very immersive, and it was really cool to see how
                        personalized it was. However, I can see how the website may be distracting for users when
                        interacting with it. There is so much for the user to see when going through the site that they
                        might get lost and lose track of the purpose of the site.

                    <h2>Overlays Design Pattern Research</h2>
                    <time datetime="2026-01-28">January 29, 2026</time>

                    <p>The article, <a
                            href="https://uxplanet.org/best-practices-for-modals-overlays-dialog-windows-c00c66cddd8c">Best
                            Practices for Modals / Overlays / Dialog Windows</a>, talks about the use of Modal windows
                        and how they should be used. I’ve had prior experience with using modal windows as a UX
                        designer. From the perspective of a UX designer, I did see the usefulness of modal windows. I
                        thought that modal windows were ways to help clear up space on a page and reduce cognitive load,
                        which it does. However, the article specified that now users would find modal windows
                        inconvenient, and how you should use modal windows intentionally.</p>
                    <p>It was interesting to see the basic anatomy of a modal window and the different attributes.
                        This would help me as a designer to consider the design patterns that users are already familiar
                        with. Reading the article makes me start to be more aware of the intentionality of using moral
                        windows and how to effectively use them to help enhance users’ experience.</p>

                    <h2>Best Practices for Form Design</h2>
                    <time datetime="2026-01-19">January 19, 2026</time>

                    <p>When reading the article, <a
                            href="https://uxdesign.cc/best-practices-for-form-design-ff5de6ca8e5f">Best practices for
                            form design</a> , I made connections between form design and UX design principles. The
                        intent with these design principles is improve users’ experience when completing a form and
                        making sure that users would interact with the form While I was familiar with most of the design
                        principles mentioned, there were some practices that I knew I would consider when designing
                        forms, like asking the complex questions last, putting the placeholder text where it wouldn’t
                        disappear when users interact with the form, and explaining why we would need users’ sensitive
                        information. Reading and learning more about form design helped me be able to keep in mind the
                        user’s experience when designing and coding my projects for this class. </p>

                    <p>A website that I’ve interacted with that exemplifies best practices would be the <a
                            href="https://www.airbnb.com/?locale=en&country_override=US">Airbnb website</a>. As I was
                        signing up for an Airbnb account, the process was simple and only required one page of forms,
                        and the overall layout was simple and easy to navigate. </p>
